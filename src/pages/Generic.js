          Sparks flew from the rails; red embers sizzled the dry spring grass and whipped against the platform’s stones. Crowds of buttoned twill coats and flat-topped caps halted. Steam billowed high towards the midday sun and fell onto rusted metal. And at once, the locomotive came to a grinding halt.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whistles blew: shrill like a crow’s cry. A uniformed man clenched the coated latch and the doors burst open. Standing inside the train was a row of stiff-backed men. Their coats were worn and stained crimson like the bandages that dressed their flesh. The men marched one by one: shy a meter apart and with their firearms pressed against their chests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eyes from the crowd followed the soldiers. The civilians raised their fists into the air and called deep from their bellies. But the celebration was short. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifteen men had entered onto the platform, the latch locked once more. The fists faltered and the voices went silent. 
        </p>

        With a stone held towards the heavens, the ashen-haired boy grinned. The station by the knotted weald flowed with fat-pocketed merchants. Where there’s travel, there’s coin. That was the opinion Zakris held.
        </p>
        <p>
        He stood atop a barrel of soot and looked at his audience: six heads no taller than his own. 
        </p>
        <p>
        “A riddle, my dear friends,” the boy gazed through the crowd, “Birthed of fire and embraced tight. Uncased and brought alight to hold monuments in place-” 
        </p>
        <p>“For hell's sake, a rock! You're holding it even,” an ornery boy shouted.
        </p>
        <p>
        Zakris’s grin remained. He looked to a girl with brown doe-like eyes. She caught the stone he tossed. Its bumpy craters left space for her fingers to explore. But the ornery watcher sneered.
        </p>
        <p>
        “And? What of it? You’ve called us out here for pilfered garbage? Run out of material, is it?”
        </p>
        <p>
        Zakris reached down to his sack and retrieved another stone and held it to his cheek. 
        </p>
        <p>
        “Three coins a piece from each of you. That’s the fee for today’s performance.”
        </p>
        <p>
        Laughter burst from the crowd. 
        </p>
        <p>
        “You’ve gone drunk sipping goat milk on your papa’s farm, Zakris. No show of yours is worth more than spit.”
        </p>
        <p>
        “One coin. Only one for a taste of what’s to come,” Zakris said as he brushed the stone against his lips, “And to see if I live to perform again.”
        </p>
        <p>
        The crowd was silent and the girl’s eyes grew wide. The performer took it as his cue to continue, “One coin for me to swallow this stone whole.”
        </p>
        <p>
        Whispers circled. Wide smiles emerged with cackling laughter. The young girl was the only one to shake her head.
        </p>
        <p>
        From the crowd emerged the ornery boy waving a piece of bronze in the air. Zakris bowed as he took the payment. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Zakris contorted his jaw like a python and pressed the stone against his lips. It scraped against his teeth without sound and he gagged as rock reached his throat. With a final push, the stone was lost in darkness. Zakris’s face contorted and turned red. He grabbed onto his throat with both hands.
        </p>
        <p>
        The girl gasped, but her cries were drowned out by laughter. Tears filled her eyes; Her gaze locked onto the choking boy. He turned his head towards her, smiled, and swallowed. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Zakris flipped his head back, sending his curls cascading in the air. He stuck out his tongue and sighs broke out from the crowd. 
        </p>
        <p>
        They were silent and then thrust their coins forward, “Bet the next one’ll kill him for sure.” 
        </p>
        <p>
        The boy laughed to himself as he collected the bronze pieces. Though, his smile faded as he looked to the girl. Her arms were crossed tight and her foot tapped like a beating drum. <i>“I’ll be getting an earful after this.”</i>
